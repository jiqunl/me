### About Me
I am an **Assistant Professor of Data Science** and **Adjunct Assistant Professor of Psychology** at the University of Oklahoma (OU). I hold a PhD in Information Science from Rutgers iSchool. I currently work with my students at the [Human-Computer Interaction and Recommendation (HCIR) Lab](https://ouhcirgroup.github.io/) at OU. 

My research focuses on the intersection of human-centered data science, interactive information seeking/retrieval, and cognitive psychology, and seeks to apply the knowledge learned about people interacting with information in adaptive recommendation and debiasing, user education and intelligent nudging. My recent studies/projects include: 1) **Psychology-Informed Intelligent Information Retrieval**: investigating the impacts of users' cognitive states and in-situ preferences on their search decision-making and evaluations of information system performances, with the ultimate goal of making intelligent systems more sensitive to diverse human needs, values and biases; 2) **Bias-aware Adaptive Recommendations**: understanding user biases and bounded rationality that affect and contextualize human-information interaction and leveraging the knowledge about biases on both user and system sides in developing and evaluating fair, sustainable, and ethical system recommendations. My recent CV can be found at [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BEfDCNnS-49RPj4Lt-pGEYd1dSHuNmts/view?usp=share_link).

**[*Note to Perspective Students:*]** I am actively looking for self-motivated students to join my Human-Computer Interaction and Recommendation group at OU and work on interesting cutting-edge problems in information retrieval and intelligent systems. Research opportunities are available at both undergraduate and graduate levels. I am especially interested in students with **any** of the following backgrounds:
- Human-Computer Interaction, Interactive Information Seeking/Retrieval, Cognitive Psychology or Experimental Economics using quantitative or qualitative methods (or both);
- Machine Learning, Recommender System, Natural Language Processing (NLP), or Text/Data Mining.

If you are interested, please email me at (jiqunliu@ou.edu) with your CV and a brief description of your previous research experiences & current research interests.
