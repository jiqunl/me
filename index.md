### About Me
I am an **Assistant Professor of Data Science** at the University of Oklahoma. I hold a PhD in Information Science from Rutgers iSchool.

My research focuses on the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI), interactive information seeking/retrieval, and cognitive psychology, and seeks to apply the knowledge learned about people interacting with information in adaptive recommendation, user education and intelligent nudging. My recent studies/projects include: 1) **Cognitive Pscyhology + Information Retrieval + Machine Learning**: investigating the impacts of users' systematic cognitive biases on their search decision-making and evaluations of information seeking/search episodes, with the ultimate goal of making intelligent systems more sensitive to human biases and concerns; 2) **State-aware Adaptive IR System**: identifying the states of complex tasks that contextualize human-information interaction and applying the knowledge about states in developing and evaluating adaptive system recommendations. My recent CV can be found at [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VO86C0SqhAp2N65q3N3nrPn2QfWVvuia/view?usp=sharing).

**[*Note to Perspective Students:*]** I am actively looking for self-motivated students to join my Human-Computer Interaction and Recommendation group at OU and work on interesting cutting-edge problems in information retrieval and intelligent systems. Research opportunities are available at both undergraduate and graduate levels. I am especially interested in students with **any** of the following backgrounds:
- Human-Computer Interaction, Interactive Information Seeking/Retrieval, Cognitive Psychology or Experimental Economics using quantitative or qualitative methods (or both);
- Machine Learning, Recommender System, Natural Language Processing (NLP), or Text/Data Mining.

If you are interested, please email me at (jiqunliu@ou.edu) with your CV and a brief description of your previous research experiences & current research interests.
