### About me
I am an **Assistant Professor of Data Science** at the University of Oklahoma. I hold a PhD in Information Science from Rutgers iSchool.

My research focuses on the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI), interactive information seeking/retrieval, and computational economics, and seeks to apply the knowledge learned from people interacting with information in search recommendation, user education and intelligent nudging. My recent studies/projects include: 1) **Behavioral Economics + Information Retrieval + Machine Learning**: investigating the impacts of users' systematic cognitive biases on their search decision-making and evaluations of information seeking/search episodes; 2) **State-aware Task Support System**: identifying the states of complex tasks that contextualize human-information interaction and applying the knowledge about states in developing and evaluating adaptive system recommendations. My recent CV can be found at [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SEg_iZSxrHYaKr3guyMeRyeUQRMC-HQ-/view).
